> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." ~Steve Jobs
<p> I have spent a lot of time creating and designs over the years. Understanding how each and every single component on the screen impact the viewer's experience and like Steve Jobs says, the best designs are always the ones that serves it's purpose and one which have a definative functionality. </p>

<p> With that design philosophy in mind, I have created this super simple and minimalistic portfolio of myself, which exactly serves the purpose it was made for. </p>

<p>I hope you view my website and if it inspires you, feel free to contact me and together we can work on amazing projects in the future! <br> Thanks :)</p>
